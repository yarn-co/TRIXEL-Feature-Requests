# TRIXEL Feature Requests
Keeping track of stuff people want to see in TRIXEL

![What's Next](http://i.imgur.com/qdAV1wR.png?2)

## What's this all about?
A place for TRIXELians to request new features and any other changes, bug fixes, pizza orders etc to TRIXEL. 
We at TRIXEL wanted to set up a channel for y'all to tell us about the shortcomings of our work. Tear us apart, yo!

## How to Request a Feature
Submit an issue to this repository. An issue is basically an email; some text, maybe an image and some links that notifies the addressee (us) that we need to give you some of our time. 

See the **circle with the exclamation point** in the icon menu to the right? That's the issue button. Click it to open an issue, click the green **New Issue** button, then type in what you want to request from us. Then click the "Submit" button and we'll be notified of your request. 

### What should you include?
Well, you can do whatever you want #SatreLife. We can't police your keyboards, ya dig? </br>
Helpfully, though, we figure you should think about the following: </br>
- It would be really fun if __________ </br>
- What do I want to do that I can't do right now? </br>
- If I could add anything to the world of TRIXEL, I would ________ </br>
- What's difficult, frustrating, or impossible to do right now?  </br>


## Disclaimers
_Response Time_

We're a small startup </br>
We have very limited resources </br>
We're currently developing other projects </br>
We sincerely care about your feedback, but will struggle to respond to it in any sort of timely fashion unless someone gives us a fat stack of that charity investment money any time soon. We're trying, but that doesn't mean much. </br>
We're sorry. </br>
Life is pain.


_Why didn't we do the thing you asked?_

We won't build every request. As Point 1 illustrates, life is too painful to build even the "small" batch of ones we have already. Instead, we'll look for patterns in y'all's feedback and build the features most often requested.
