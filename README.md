# TRIXEL Feature Requests
Keeping track of stuff people want to see in TRIXEL

## What's this all about?
A place for TRIXELians to request new features and any other changes, bug fixes, pizza orders etc to TRIXEL. 
We at TRIXEL wanted to set up a channel for y'all to tell us about the shortcomings of our work. Tear us apart, yo!

## Disclaimers
_Response Time_

We're a small startup </br>
We have very limited resources </br>
We're currently developing other projects </br>
We sincerely care about your feedback, but will struggle to respond to it in any sort of timely fashion unless someone gives us a fat stack of that charity investment money any time soon. We're trying, but that doesn't mean much. </br>
We're sorry. </br>
Life is pain.


_Why didn't we do the thing you asked?_

We won't build every request. As Point 1 illustrates, life is too painful to build even the "small" batch of ones we have already. Instead, we'll look for patterns in y'all's feedback and build the features most often requested. 

## How to Request a Feature
Submit an issue to this repository. An issue is basically an email; some text, maybe an image and some links that notifies the addressee (us) that we need to give you some of our time. 

See the circle with the exclamation point in the icon menu to the right? That's the issue button. Click it to open an issue, then type in what you want to request from us. Then click the "Submit" button and we'll be notified of your request. 

### Helpful info to include in your issue
- What the feature is (brief description)
- Why you want the feature (What stupid thing was TRIXEL doing that you'd like improved? What cool stuff would happen if that feature existed?)
- How the feature would work (Like, brief description of the steps of user interactions (Click on TRIXEL, Enter address, Pizza ordered!!...we're backburnering the TRIXEL-Dominos integration unless we receive overwhelming support for it))
- Links to the TRIXELation(s) that inspired your request (I was drawing this thing, then I thought "it'd be cool to have this thing!")
